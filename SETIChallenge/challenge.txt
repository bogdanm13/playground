Suppose a telescope on Earth receives a series of pulses from a fixed, unresolved source beyond the solar system. 
The source is a star about 50 light years from Earth. 
The pulses are in the form of short/long signals and they are received in a very narrow band around an electromagnetic frequency of 452.12919 MHz. 
A computer algorithm identifies the artificial nature of the pulses. 
It turns out the pulses carry a message. 
The pulses signify binary digits. Suppose further that you were, by whatsoever reason, put in charge of decoding this message.

If you successfully encrypted the message, you should be able to answer the following questions:
* What is the typical body height of our interstellar counterparts?
* What is their typical lifetime?
* What is the scale of the devices they used to submit their message?
* Since when have they been communicating interstellar?
* What kind of object do they live on?
* How old is their stellar system?
